# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 17, 2020 (Sign Up Page Challenge)

**Today's Progress**: I started a challenge from DailyUI, the description was to "Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. It could be for a volunteer event, contest registration, a giveaway, or anything you can image." Since I felt that was too dificult for my first day, I started on a page that advertises my mug store. 

**Thoughts:** Getting back into the swing of things was difficult at first, but I felt as time increased so did my dorment knowledge of HTML and CSS.

### Day 3: April 17, 2020 (Marvelous Mugs Info Page)

**Today's Progress**: I would say that the majority of my time went to working on my navigation menu. It took me a while to get the appropriate spacing I needed because the <float> property can be difficult to work with. After that was taken care of, I added more information to the home page (images and paragraphs).

**Thoughts:** Floats can be a your best friend or your worst enemy.
